        "    *   Theory: Dictionaries provide a way to associate each unique value with its frequency.\n",

        "*   Design Choice: Tuples are designed to represent collections of items that should not be altered. This immutability provides certain guarantees about the data.\n",
        "*   Efficiency: Because tuples are immutable, Python can optimize their storage and processing. For example, tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries (since dictionary keys must be immutable), and they can be safely shared across different parts of a program without fear of accidental modification.\n",
        "*   Data Integrity: Immutability helps ensure data integrity. If you have a tuple representing a specific piece of data (like a coordinate point or a record), you can be sure that its values will remain consistent throughout your program.\n",

        "    my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",

        "    my_list[0] = 10  # Modify the first element\n",
        "    my_tuple = tuple(my_list)\n",
        "    print(my_tuple)  # Output: (10, 2, 3)\n",

        "\n",
        "- Dictionaries in Python are considered unordered because they don't store elements in a specific sequence like lists. Instead, they use a mechanism called \"hashing\" to store and retrieve data. Here's how it works and how it affects data retrieval:\n",
        "\n",
        "How Dictionaries Work:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Hashing: When you add a key-value pair to a dictionary, Python applies a hash function to the key. This function converts the key into a unique numerical value (the hash).\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Storage: The hash value is used to determine where the key-value pair is stored in the dictionary's internal storage (often a hash table). The storage location isn't based on the order you added the items.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  Retrieval: When you want to retrieve a value using a key, Python hashes the key again, gets the hash value, and uses it to quickly locate the corresponding value in the hash table.\n",
        "\n",
        "How Unordered Nature Affects Data Retrieval:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  No Indexing: Because dictionaries aren't ordered, you can't access elements by index like you can with lists (e.g., my\\_dict\\[0]). You can only access values using their keys (e.g., my\\_dict\\[\"key\"]).\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Fast Lookup: The unordered nature, combined with hashing, makes dictionary lookups incredibly fast, regardless of the size of the dictionary. The time it takes to find a value doesn't increase significantly as the dictionary grows. This is because the hash function quickly points to the location of the value.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  Iteration Order: When you iterate through a dictionary (e.g., using a for loop), the order in which the key-value pairs are processed isn't guaranteed to be the same as the order in which you added them. The order might vary depending on the implementation of the dictionary and the specific keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Summary:\n",
        "\n",
        "Dictionaries are unordered in Python because they use hashing to store data, which allows for fast retrieval based on keys, but doesn't preserve the order of insertion. This means you can't access elements by index, but lookups are very efficient. The iteration order isn't guaranteed to be the same as the insertion order."
